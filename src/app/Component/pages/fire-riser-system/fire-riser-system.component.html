        1. Dry Riser System:
      </h3>
      <p>
        A dry Riser system or dry pipe system is made of complete water-distribution system with sprinkler head or
        risers and branches with hydrants throughout the buildings in which there is no running water.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the sprinkler system the dry pipe system is used partly to protect the interior of the buildings against
        hazards of burst and leaky pipe to avoid freezing of water in the pipes.
      </p>
      <p>Water is turned into water distribution system either automatically or manually on the outbreak of fire or the
        sounding of alarm gong to smother or extinguish fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the fuse melts in due to the heat generated by fire, water gushes in and air exhausted through the
        sprinkler head quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preaction system water is admitted to the system by a valve actuated by a thermostatic controlled device
        that function in advance of the sprinkler system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distribution system is laid with a slope of about 1:200, so that the complete water is drained out of the
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Provision of necessary pressure gauges is made on main water supply, distribution, air tank, pumps, etc.
